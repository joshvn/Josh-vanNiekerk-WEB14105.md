### Introduction

I feel that this unit was valuable to me as it has stimulated my creative thought process. I learned how to best channel this so that my initial planning is most effective. This has helped me to really get to grips with what I want to achieve and how I am going to do so; before jumping straight into a project. I am very pleased with how I have handled this project - not only in terms of my own ideas, but also with my contribution in class. I've also helped my peers with ideas and given critical analysis; whilst making suggestions as to how they could improve their projects. Overall, I have enjoyed this unit and have gathered valuable skills which I will be able to integrate into future projects.
